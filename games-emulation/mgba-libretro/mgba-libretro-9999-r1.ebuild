# Here's where things get confusing. Strap in, because you're in for a ride!
# There exist two mGBA repositories:
#
# * "https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba.git", the official mGBA repository.
# * "https://github.com/libretro/mgba.git", the Libretro mGBA repository
#
# Since the latter tracks the former, the two superficially resemble one other.
# All similarities end at their build systems, however. The former ships with:
# 
# * A dynamic "cmake"-based build system reading "CMakeLists.txt" as input and
#   writing a "Makefile" as output. This system provides out-of-the-box support 
#   for compiling the mGBA Libretro core via the "-DBUILD_LIBRETRO=1"
#   configuration-time option.
#
# The latter ships with two (!) parallel build systems, only one of which is
# documented and only one of which works (...and the documented system is not
# the system that works):
#
# * A dynamic "cmake"-based build system reading "CMakeLists.txt" as input and
#   overwriting the existing "Makefile" as output. Despite explicitly including
#   a configuration-time option to enable Libretro support (e.g.,
#   "-DBUILD_LIBRETRO=1"), this system fails to compile on enabling this option.
# * An undocumented static "make"-based build system reading "Makefile" which
#   reads "Makefile.libretro" as input. Unlike the prior system, this system
#   actually succeeds in compiling the mGBA Libretro core. Unsurprisingly, this 
#   is the system used by the official "libretro-super" project to build this
#   core. Unfortunately, this system provides substantially fewer
#   configuration-time options than the prior system.
#
# There exist two options, therefore: "cmake" in the official mGBA repository
# and "make" in the Libretro mGBA repository. Since the former successfully
# compiles the mGBA Libretro core *AND* provides substantially more 
# configuration-time options, we prefer the former. Interestingly, this
# archlinux PKGBUILD for the mGBA Libretro core has made a similar choice:
#
#     https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=libretro-mgba-git
